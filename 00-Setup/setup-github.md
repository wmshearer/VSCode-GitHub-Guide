# Setup GitHub (GUI-only)

## Create / Sign in
- [ ] Go to https://github.com/
- [ ] Sign in (or create an account)

## Connect VS Code to GitHub (easy mode)
- [ ] In VS Code, bottom-left **Accounts** icon → **Sign in to GitHub**
- [ ] Follow the prompts (your browser will open, click **Authorize**)
- [ ] Back in VS Code, confirm your GitHub name shows at bottom-left

## Why this matters
- [ ] Lets VS Code **publish** your local folder as a new GitHub repo (GUI)
- [ ] Lets you **push** and **pull** without command line
